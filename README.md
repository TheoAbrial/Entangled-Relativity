# Entangled-Relativity
Internship on Entangled Relativity

ER_Internship_2025 :
A draft of a presentation of Entangled Relativity and of all the calculations I have done for the modified equations of motion in ER.

Geodesics :
Code with short explanation on equation of motion in Schwarzschild's metric and in Charged Compact non-rotating Star in ER. At the end of the notebook there is an example with Mercury's orbit.

Resolution of EoM : Resolution of the equation of motion for the solution r(phi) in GR (Reissner-Nordstr√∂m solution) and in ER. The precession of orbits and the deviation of light are calculated for each case as a function of the charge of the central mass.
